According to DG, the need to facilitate the development of a *National Transport Databank* is crucial to the development of Nigeria's transportation sector.

The proposed National Transport Databank will be Nigeria and Africa’s first online, real-time, nationwide comprehensive transportation database.

It will consist of various categories of data such as – nationwide - urban transport networks (Air, Road, Rail, and Water), critical and commercial infrastructure (e.g. Pipelines), individual travel, public transport, pedestrian data and more. The type of data in the databank will include, but not be limited to online and offline, structured and unstructured data (e.g. documents, images, databases, maps, demographics, technical data, and more)\
\
**Project Phases (Deliverables)**

Data collected and collated within the NTD project will originate from active and passive sources, such as survey research, private entities and public institutions that cover a wide range of multi-modal transport. In terms of real-time data, cooperation with states and parastatals, as well as private companies, can provide wide-spread opportunities to use dynamic transport data and to further develop data analysis and reporting systems.

In the future the number of collaborating entities and their datasets will increase dramatically as the data analysis and reporting systems are extended. Optimal use of the available data is indispensable in realising an intelligent transport system that is efficient, reduces congestion, minimises environmental impacts and measurably increases safety and security.\
\
**NTD’s development and delivery will occur in four (4) phases:**\
\
•**Phase 1**\
This phase is a concept and technical pilot of key NTD systems and operations required for NTD’s essential functions. It will demonstrate specific transport data digitisation, collection, retention, processing, and dissemination. This phase will identify and engage particular data, information, and intelligence sources and contributors.\
\
•**Phase 2**\
This phase develops and integrates an Operational NTD system with essential networks, systems, and services. This includes collecting, organising, processing, and analysing data for all modes of transportation.\
\
•**Phase 3**\
This phase scales up and scales out the Operational NTD system with transport and transport-related data from Public and Private organisations. This phase also creates a vital set of NTD operations, communications, and collaboration services.\
\
•**Phase 4**\
This phase completes, deploys, and delivers the National Transport Databank.
