The National Institute for Transport Technology (NITT) Zaria, says it is collaborating with the Intelligence Transport System (ITS) UK to generate a National Transport Data Bank to strengthen Nigeria’s transport and logistics industry. \
\
Dr. Bayero Salih-Farah, Director General NITT made this known in an interaction with newsmen in Zaria on Tuesday. He said the data would enable the institute act as the center of transport intelligence in Nigeria, in line with its mandate.\
\
He noted that lack of comprehensive data on the logistics and transport industry was a major problem hindering the development of the sector. \
\
In his comment, Dr Joshua Odeleye, NITT’s Director of Transport Research and Intelligence said the data would cover road, air, marine, rail and pipeline transportation.\
\
Odeleye said the data bank would share the information generated with policy makers and other key players in transport and logistics sector for proper planning and investment.

“We are now working towards linking with stakeholders to have a harmonised data, so that government would have a total picture of the performance level of all modes of transport,’’ he said.

In related development, the Director-General said the institute has also partnered the National Information Technology Agency (NITDA) on knowledge sharing.

He added that the institute was working towards the vision of becoming a leading transport and logistics institute in Africa.

To achieve this, Salih-Farah said new structures, facilities and centers were being provided across the country by the institute, to upgrade its standard.

He said the institute was also working on reducing cases of injuries and death resulting from road traffic accidents in the country. (NAN)
