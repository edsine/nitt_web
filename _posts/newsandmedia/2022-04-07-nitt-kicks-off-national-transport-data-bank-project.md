THE Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT) Zaria, in partnership with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), has flagged off the national transport data bank project survey for the development of a viable transport data bank system in the country.

Speaking at the event in Lagos, the Director General/ Chief Executive of NITT, Zaria, Dr. Aminu Musa Yusuf said that working closely with NBS through an action plan would bring about the commencement of a sustainable transport data collection exercise.

He said: “The transport sector being the fulcrum of any nation’s economy cannot be ignored”. He noted that the survey was, therefore, critical as it would address the need to have a huge amount of data-related to transport professionally collected, analyzed, stored and disseminated for proper planning purposes and development for rational decision making.

He also said the importance of data planning; research and development of a nation cannot be over emphasized, this is because the effectiveness and success of any planning largely depends on the availability of reliable and accurate data, adding that, it is also on record that one of the major challenges in this country especially for policy makers, researchers and planners is the dearth and paucity of data.

Yusuf added that the survey was aimed at developing a solid foundation for a multimodal transport data collection platform, collection of an up-to-date and reliable data on all modes of transport in Lagos State, and carry out a comprehensive warehousing of transport data base so that Nigerians would be disseminated to government agencies and relevant stakeholders in the country.\
“The choice of Lagos for this critical pilot survey is predicated on the obvious fact that all transport modes, operations and infrastructures are available in the state,” he said.

He assured Lagosians that other states in Nigeria would also be fully covered, all things being equal.\
In his closing remark, he urged all field officers and their supervisors to put in their best efforts towards the collection of reliable and adequate data., adding that, undoubtedly, there will be challenges in the field “But I have no doubt in mind that the training and briefs you have received will see you through’’. He said
