The Nigerian Institute for Transport Technology (NITT) and the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) have disagreed over powers of the FRSC to train drivers and motorists in the country.



While the NITT insisted that FRSC lacked powers to train drivers and motorists, the corps maintained that it has authority to train drivers and other road users.



Addressing newsmen after a three-day retreat organized by the institute in Kaduna, Chairman of NITT’s Governing Council, John Onogheharho, said some institutions, including the FRSC, which have no mandate to give training on transport and logistics, were creeping in to hijack the institute’s responsibilities.

He said the FRSC had even partnered with the Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) to establish a driving school for training of cadets in the rudiments, theory and practical knowledge of driving.



“The major challenge is the issue of quackery. There are a lot of quacks offering training and manpower development in transportation and logistics and they are not actually standardized and capable of offering those services.



“One of the challenges is that people take up roles that they are not set up to do or capable of doing. There are institutions that are not authorized to train people in this sector. I don’t want to mention organizations, but even (FRSC), has started training and this is not their core mandate, that is NITT’s mandate,” he stated.



But in a swift reaction, the FRSC said it was authorized to train drivers and motorists, adding that the agency has the mandate to do so.
