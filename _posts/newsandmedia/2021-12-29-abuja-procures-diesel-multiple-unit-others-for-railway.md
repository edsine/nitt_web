No fewer than 12 truck and car trainee drivers have graduated in the just concluded week-long training course on “General Truck Training and Certification” organized by the Transport Technology Centre (TTC) of Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT), Zaria.

While presiding over the practice session prior to the award of certificates to the participants, TTC Director, Engr. Elkanah Ngbale urged trained truck drivers especially to always abide by the principles for starting and driving a truck.

According to him, “You must ensure that you wait after starting a truck engine to allow air to build up to the desired level before moving. Also, get out of the truck and listen for any air leaks; check tires amongst other things in the checklist to keep the vehicle and yourself safe”, he added.

Elkanah, also noted that the driving lessons inculcated in the participants “are world-class in nature.” As such, he said that they could productively practice in Nigeria and anywhere around the world.

The participants were drawn from private sector organizations in some states in the six Geo-political Zones, namely, Abia, Rivers, Enugu, Oyo, Kwara, Nasarawa and Kaduna States.

One of the participants from Taraba State, Mr. Sam David, said that his participation in the course had improved his driving skills. He said that he was able to drive from NITT Premises to PZ in Zaria (8.3kms away) and back without a hitch under the supervision of the Driving Instructor.

While appreciating the NITT DG/CE, Dr. Bayero Salih Farah, for supporting his Department (TTC) with funds amongst other things to facilitate the running of the course, he called on government transport and logistics concerns in the country to emulate the private organizations that had participated in the course. “Doing so will encourage the Institute to do more to improve driving culture in the country.”, he added.

He equally called on the participants to be responsible ambassadors of the Institute and to always discharge their duties professionally in their respective organizations
