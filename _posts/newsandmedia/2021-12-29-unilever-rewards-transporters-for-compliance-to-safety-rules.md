Jigawa State Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar has said that “Jigawa State is open to ideas, advice and proposals from NITT.”

The Governor stated this while receiving the Director General/Chief Executive, Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT), Zaria, Dr. Bayero Salih Farah, who paid him a courtesy call at Government House, Dutse, recently with Staff and Masters in Transport and Logistics (MTL) Participants on Field Visit to the State.

The Governor’s statement came on the heels of the speech made by the NITT helmsman to acquaint him with the history and activities of the Institute as well as some reasons for the visit.
Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, also expressed interest in the National Innovation Diploma (NID) programmes newly introduced by NITT aimed at encouraging hands-on learning amongst youths in the country.

According to him, Jigawa State would be interested in the Welding and Fabrication programme for a start. He however implored the NITT to submit a proposal to the State for appraisal going forward.

The Governor also said that his predecessor bequeathed him with a workable transport master plan for the State and that he was willing to work with NITT to make it a reality.
