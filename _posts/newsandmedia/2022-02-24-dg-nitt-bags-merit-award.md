The Director General and Chief Executive of Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT), Zaria, Dr. Bayero Salih Farah, has been conferred with a merit award by Northern Youths For National Development.



Presenting the award to him, the President, Northern Youths Forum For National Development, Hon. Turaki Abubakar, stated that the recognition was born out of the humongous infrastructural developments NITT had witnessed under Dr. Farrah’s leadership. Hon. Turaki noted that the Grand Patron and the Patron, the Sultan of Sokoto and Emir of Zazzau, respectively, have their nod to the award.

Speaking further, Hon. Turaki described Dr. Farrah as ” humble, gentle, level headed and a team worker” who discharges his duties with “diligence, commitment, dedication and professionalism”.



In his acceptance speech, the DG, NITT, Dr. Bayero Salih Farrah, said he was “honored by the recognition and award”, adding that it would “spur me to perform my duties even more diligently”.
